		<span id="first" class="js">JavaScript</span> (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/[6]),
		often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed,
		prototype-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming language.
		Alongside <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span>, <span class="js">JavaScript</span>
		is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content
		production. It is used to make webpages interactive and provide online
		programs, including video games. The majority of websites employ it,
		and all modern web browsers support it without the need for plug-ins
		by means of a built-in <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engine. Each
		of the many <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engines represent a
		different implementation of <span class="js">JavaScript</span>, all
		based on the ECMAScript specification, with some engines not
		supporting the spec fully, and with many engines supporting additional
		features beyond ECMA.
